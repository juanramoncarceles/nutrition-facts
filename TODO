☐ Open list in an interesting way.
☐ Food title should be capitalized and with spaces.
☐ At start put a button in the center to open the food list.
☐ Show that those are values for 100g/100ml.

Maybe:
☐ When the list is opened the container doesn't transition.
☐ When a new item is selected it should transition also from 0 opacity to 1.


DONE:
  ✔ The filter to look for a food item in the list doesn't work. @done(20-08-10 10:33)
  ✔ When the list is opened the selected item transitions from opacity 1 to transparent. It should be transparent always without any transition. @done(20-08-10 11:06)
  ✘ Connect to Google Sheets with all the data. @cancelled(20-08-10 17:25)
  ✔ Change the fill of the Kcal. text depending on how is the stroke to make it more visible. @done(20-08-10 18:31)
