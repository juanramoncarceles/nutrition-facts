☐ Connect to Google Sheets with all the data.
☐ Open list in an interesting way.

Maybe:
☐ When the list is opened the container doesn't transition.
☐ When a new item is selected it should transition also from 0 opacity to 1.


DONE:
  ✔ The filter to look for a food item in the list doesn't work. @done(20-08-10 10:33)
  ✔ When the list is opened the selected item transitions from opacity 1 to transparent. It should be transparent always without any transition. @done(20-08-10 11:06)
